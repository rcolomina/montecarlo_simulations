# Monte Carlo Simulations 

This project aim is to build a schema for Monte Carlo Simulation Schema with examples. Actually this project was created from the requirement to check a particular geometric problem.

The kernel of this project is a random number generator (RNG) from its seed. A seed is a number parameter for the RNG allowing to produce repeatable experiments. It is a tradition to chose 42 to wink the film "The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy". 

## Random Number Generator

In order to apply MC, a good random number generator is requried to create samples.

## Monte Carlo Method (MC)

The mathematical foundations of MC are in the law of big numbers. 

MC calculates expected values of random variables.  

## Geometric Area Calculations Inside of a Square

Imagine we have a square surface of side L. We draw from each square's vertex, with a compass a quarter of circumference of radius L. These four quarters of circumferences intersects into a central area A, which will be calculated with MC.

To check MC, this works as testing case, because using geometry principles, the exact solution can be found:

`A = (1/6) * L^2 * ( 6 * SQRT(3) - 2 PI + 6 )`
