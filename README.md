# Monte Carlo Simulations Schema and Examples

This project aim is to build a schema for Monte Carlo Simulation Schema with examples. Actually this project was created from the requirement to check a particular geometric problem.

The kernel of this project is a random number generator (RNG) from its seed. A seed is a number parameter for the RNG allowing to produce repeatable experiments. It is a tradition to chose 42 to wink the film "The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy". 

# Random Number Generator

# Monte Carlo Method (MC)

The mathematical foundations of MC come from the law of big numbers. MC calculates expectations on random variables [TBC] 

# Monte Carlo Application

This section shows basic MC applications. [TBC: Describe nature of the examples]

## Geometric Area Calculations Inside of a Square

Imagine we have a square with side L. We are going to draw from each square's vertex using a compass the quarter of circumference of radius L. These four quarters of circumferences intersects into an area A that we pretend to calculate using Monte Carlo method. 

From geometry can be calculated the exact solution using simple geometric methods. It turns out that A is (1/6) * L^2 * ( 6 * SQRT(3) - 2 PI + 6 ).
